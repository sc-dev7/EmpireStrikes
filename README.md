# **SCHOOL - Project**

## **DESCRIPTION**  
The **EmpireStrikes** project consists of creating a program that simulates a battle system for a strategy game. The program will handle the creation of units, their movements, and their interactions in a grid-based battlefield. The goal is to develop a simple game engine that allows users to control units, engage in combat, and manage the battlefield.
